I currently work as a Software Engineer in the Insurance community at Ita√∫, specializing in developing systems and applications both on the frontend and backend.

I work on developing APIs and services using tools such as Spring Boot, Kafka, and Terraform to build robust and scalable systems. Additionally, I work on the frontend when necessary, especially with Angular.

I have knowledge in AWS services, including Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, SQS, SNS, EventBridge, and IAM, among others. Furthermore, I have experience with Docker for creating and managing containers, SQL for relational database manipulation and management, and CI/CD practices for continuous integration and delivery of software.
